\begin{description}
    \item[]
    The \emph{is\_call} attribute is a bool variable wich identifies if the user
    want's to unlock the door or call a apartment user.
    \item[]
    The \emph{lock\_code} and the \emph{ap\_code} are containers for valid 
    door unlock codes and apartment numbers.
    \item[]
    The \emph{reset\_time} and \emph{unlock\_time} store the values of the
    phone lock reset time (if no key is pressed) and how long the door stays
    unlocked.
    \item[]
    The \emph{lock()} and \emph{unlock()} methods control the door lock.
    \item[] 
    The \emph{call()} and \emph{hang\_up()} methods are used for establishing
    and terminating connections between the lock phone and the apartment phone.
    \item[]
    The \emph{verificate\_phone\_code} and \emph{verificate\_unlock\_code}
    methods check if the entered code is valid.

    \item[]
    We start with the \emph{wait for keypress} state, if we press the \emph{C} key the system
    sets the \emph{is\_call} variable to 0 and stays in this state, 
    if we press a numeric key we go to the \emph{key 1} state.
    \item[]
    From the \emph{key 1} state we can proceed with a numeric key
    to the \emph{key 2} state from which also with a 
    numeric key procced to the \emph{key 3} state.
    \item[]
    In the \emph{key 3} state we can proceed with a numeric key but depending on the
    \emph{is\_call} attribute we go to different states. If the \emph{is\_call} is true
    we go to the \emph{key 4} state if it's false we go to the \emph{verificate lock code}
    state.
    \item[]
    From the \emph{key 4} state we can proceed with the \emph{C} key 
    to the \emph{verificate phone code} state.
    \item[]
    If we don't change states from the \emph{key 1-4} states in 10 seconds 
    we proceed to the \emph{reset} state which sets the \emph{is\_call} attribute
    to true and goes to the \emph{wait for keypress} state.
    \item[]
    The \emph{verificate lock code} state and the \emph{verificate phone code} state
    are used for code verification, if the code is rejected both go to the 
    \emph{wait for keypress} state.
    \item[]
    If the lock code is accepted we go to the \emph{unlocked} state wich unlocks the
    door upon entry and locks it upon exit, we go back to the \emph{wait for keypress}
    after 30 seconds and set the \emph{is\_call} attribute to 1.
    \item[]
    If the phone code is accepted we go to the \emph{call} state. The \emph{call} state
    tries to call the apartement user if the connection is established it proceeds to the
    \emph{talk} state if it fails to establish a connection it goes to the 
    \emph{wait for keypress} state.
    \item[]
    In the \emph{talk} state we can go back to the \emph{wait for keypress} state
    if the apartment user hangs up or if we press the \emph{R} key.
    \item[]
    A stop state isn't needed because the phone lock should always wait for a keypress.
